== Goshubot
An extensible Bot Platform

= TODO
goshubot.py
	search for config file that contains server, channel, etc
	 (think the JSON settings file similar to Za Geemu)

Logging Module:
	Change name to Output Module, make it so you can turn on/off printing/logging
	Rewrite to create the time, nick, message, and then runs them through print/log
	Make it able to intercept bot responses (modification to irclib may be needed)
