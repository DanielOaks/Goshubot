module functions:
	If called like: logtext(None, None)
	 then the function will output information about itself instead of running
	Stuff like Name, Private, Password, Description, etc

Logging Module:
	Change name to Output Module, make it so you can turn on/off printing/logging
	Rewrite to create the time, nick, message, and then runs them through print/log
